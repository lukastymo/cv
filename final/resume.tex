\subsubsection{Data Engineer (contract)}\label{data-engineer-contract}}

\emph{Royal Mail \textbar{} GBI} May 2018 -- November 2018, London, UK

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I was part of Data Engineering team. I developed Data Platform and
  data algorithms on it which transformed the whole business and allowed
  releasing multiple great products. I advised and recommended best
  practices in Scala, Agile and Software Development, Architecture.
\item
  I implemented opt-1, opt-2 and opt-3 heuristic to solve VRP (Vehicle
  routing problem). This algorithm was essential for Royal Mail
  business, as it is unpractical to solve this task manually. Thanks to
  this algorithm another project ``Late Arrival Packages'' was able to
  kick off.
\item
  I developed parcel delivery project which processed terabytes of data
  in a few hours. I was responsible for productionizing (porting from
  POC Python code to Scala) and implemented new features for Machine
  Learning modules: Train, Test, Post-process and Formatter. This
  project was able to predict 90\% of all packages UK-wide with 2-hour
  precision.
\end{itemize}

Tech stack:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scala (main production language), Python (PoC)
\item

\emph{IHS Markit \textbar{} Risk Factor Utility (FRTB)} September 2017
-- May 2018, London, UK

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I productionized Spark application on AWS (S3, EC2, EMR) with strong
  automatization requirement via Ansible and CloudFormation. Due to this
  change deployment across environments was consistent and automated, so
  everybody on the team could do this by clicking one button in Jenkins.
\item
  I was part of the team which implemented very popular, and in-demand
  project required transforming the significant amount of raw market
  data into FRTB-compliant risk factors and scenarios by using DSL
  language for risk modelling.
\item
  I helped developing functional Scala project, which the main module
  was a custom DSL language used by Quants. Thanks to this feature, our
  quants were able to produce FRTB solutions presented for multiple
  banks.
\end{itemize}

Tech stack:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scala, Cats, Monix Tasks, Apache Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra

\emph{OVO Energy \textbar{} vCharge} April 2017 -- September 2017,
London, UK

\begin{itemize}
\item
  vCharge was a startup acquired by Ovo Energy. The idea was to control
  storage heaters installed in people homes. I worked with the owner,
  who was located in the US (\textasciitilde{} daily one-to-one online
  meetings). I had a high impact on stakeholders. Throughout a couple of
  months, I was the only Scala developer.
\item
  I built a module to forecasting Energy prices using the Dijkstra
  algorithm and mathematical model created by Data Scientists. It
  allowed buying energy cheaper and ``store'' in the customers' storage
  heaters.
\end{itemize}

  Sourcing, Cassandra

Fasttrack} February 2016 -- April 2017, London, UK

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I developed an auto-grader module inside the web-based application
  deployed on HMRC's Tax Platform. The module allowed to assess and send
  emails to 120,000 candidates in a day-scale vs month-scale in the
  legacy system.
