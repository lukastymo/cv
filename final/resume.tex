  Kubernetes
\item
  Rapid development of small simulations in Scala and Akka
\item
  Event-driven architecture, Event Sourcing / CQRS

\emph{Linklaters \textbar{} Nakhoda} November 2018 -- December 2019,
London, UK

\begin{itemize}
\item
  My work in the project required a lot of proactiveness and
  programming. Firstly, I clarified requirements between lawyers,
  frontend developers and designers. Then, I suggested best solution for
  the problem, and finally I implemented the feature(s) in a one-week
  sprint.
\item
  I implemented essential modules in the project: Document Approvals,
  Comments, Custom Job Queue solutions.
\item
  I promoted and implemented Gatling performance tests attached to our
  CI/CD pipeline.

  data algorithms on it which transformed the whole business and allowed
  releasing multiple great products. I advised and recommended best
  practices in Scala, Agile and Software Development, Architecture.
\item
  I implemented opt-1, opt-2 and opt-3 heuristic to solve VRP (Vehicle
  routing problem). This algorithm was essential for Royal Mail
  business, as it is unpractical to solve this task manually. Thanks to
  this algorithm another project ``Late Arrival Packages'' was able to
  kick off.
\item
  I developed parcel delivery project which processed terabytes of data
  in a few hours. I was responsible for productionizing (porting from
  POC Python code to Scala) and implemented new features for Machine
  Learning modules: Train, Test, Post-process and Formatter. This
  project was able to predict 90\% of all packages UK-wide with 2-hour
  precision.

  automatization requirement via Ansible and CloudFormation. Due to this
  change deployment across environments was consistent and automated, so
  everybody on the team could do this by clicking one button in Jenkins.
\item
  I was part of the team which implemented very popular, and in-demand
  project required transforming the significant amount of raw market
  data into FRTB-compliant risk factors and scenarios by using DSL
  language for risk modelling.
\item
  I helped developing functional Scala project, which the main module
  was a custom DSL language used by Quants. Thanks to this feature, our
  quants were able to produce FRTB solutions presented for multiple
  banks.

  meetings). I had a high impact on stakeholders. Throughout a couple of
  months, I was the only Scala developer.
